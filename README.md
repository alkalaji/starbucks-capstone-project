# Starbucks customers and offers data analysis
This reposoitory is for the capstone project of Udacity's data science nano degree, utilizing Starbucks data

## Introduction
In this notebooks we analyze the data provided by Starbucks simulating customer behavior in response to offers through their mobile app. We follow CRISP-DM to analyze the data and gain insights into how customers interact with those offers. We will also answer different questions that are important to the business.

## Motivation
Offers are an important tool for engaging your customers, promoting new offerings, or increasing loyalty. Therefore it is very important to understand:
- How different customers interact with different offers
- How those offers change customer behavior and spending
- Being able to target the right customer with the right offer
